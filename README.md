# Random Walks Simulator

This Python project simulates and visualizes random walks in 1D, 2D, and 3D dimensions. The program calculates the number of returns to the origin for each walk and visualizes the distribution of these returns across different dimensions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
